1. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is matrix transform that takes a sample
   vector and outputs a vector of frequency components. It works in O(n^2)
   time.

2. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a more efficient algorithm to perform 
   DFT. It takes advantage of symmetric properties of the DFT matrix, 
   reducing the run time of the algorithm to O(n*log(n))

3. FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) ? a really fast low-level
   implementation of FFT written in C. Supports architecture-specific
   optimisations and non-power-of-2 sizes.
